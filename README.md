This repo contains three toy projects (Python, C++ and Android) that are all built with Bazel. The Bazel code
uses the old WORKSPACE-based system.
Each of the projects has at least one Open Source library as an external dependency.

It is meant as a test input for the Bazel support in [OSS Review Toolkit](https://oss-review-toolkit.org/).
